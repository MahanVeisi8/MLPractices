# Machine Learning Practices

Welcome to the machine learning practices repository! This repository contains four directories, each focusing on a specific machine learning practice.

## Practice 1: Decision Trees and KNN
- **Directory:** [Practice Number 1](1)
- **Goals:** Implement and evaluate Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms. Explore hyperparameter tuning techniques and model evaluation.

## Practice 2: Stroke Prediction and Insurance Cost Prediction
- **Directory:** [MLPractices/2](MLPractices/2)
- **Goals:** Predict stroke occurrence and insurance costs using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Linear Regression models. Handle missing values, feature scaling, and evaluate model performance.

## Practice 3: Simple Neural Network Implementation and Training
- **Directory:** [MLPractices/3](MLPractices/3)
- **Goals:** Implement a simple neural network from scratch and train it using the backpropagation algorithm. Gain insights into the training process and parameter optimization.

## Practice 4: Implementing DBSCAN Algorithm and Clustering
- **Directory:** [MLPractices/4](MLPractices/4)
- **Goals:** Implement the DBSCAN algorithm for density-based clustering. Visualize clustering results and explore different hyperparameter combinations.

Feel free to explore each practice directory for detailed implementations, code, and results!
