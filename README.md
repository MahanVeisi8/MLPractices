## Practice 2: Stroke Prediction and Insurance Cost Prediction
- **[Practice Number 2](2)**
- **Goals:** Predict stroke occurrence and insurance costs using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Linear Regression models. Handle missing values, feature scaling, and evaluate model performance.

## Practice 3: Simple Neural Network Implementation and Training
- ****[Practice Number 3](3)****
- **Goals:** Implement a simple neural network from scratch and train it using the backpropagation algorithm. Gain insights into the training process and parameter optimization.

## Practice 4: Implementing DBSCAN Algorithm and Clustering
- ****[Practice Number 4](4)****
- **Goals:** Implement the DBSCAN algorithm for density-based clustering. Visualize clustering results and explore different hyperparameter combinations.
