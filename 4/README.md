# Practice 4: Implementing DBSCAN Algorithm and Clustering

This practice involves implementing the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster two provided datasets and visualizing the clusters using scatter plots.

## Overview

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm capable of discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes without requiring the number of clusters to be specified beforehand. It categorizes data points into Core Points, Border Points, and Noise Points based on density in the feature space.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Loading and Visualization**: 
    - Load the provided datasets (d1.csv and d2.csv) and visualize them using scatter plots to understand their distribution.

2. **Understanding DBSCAN**: 
    - Explain the DBSCAN algorithm and its main hyperparameters: Epsilon (Œµ) and MinPoints.

3. **DBSCAN Implementation**: 
    - Implement DBSCAN using the `sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN` class.
    - Explore different hyperparameter combinations to find the optimal parameters for clustering each dataset.

4. **Clustering Visualization**:
    - Visualize the clustering results using scatter plots with different colors representing different clusters.

## Detailed Steps and Observations

- **Dataset 1 Visualization**:
    - Scatter plot of Dataset 1 to visualize its distribution.

- **DBSCAN Hyperparameter Exploration**:
    - Explore different combinations of epsilon (Œµ) and min_samples for Dataset 1 to find the best parameters.
    - Visualize the clustering results for each combination.

- **Dataset 2 Exploration**:
    - Apply DBSCAN to Dataset 2 and explore hyperparameters similar to Dataset 1.
    - Visualize the clustering results.

- **Final Clustering Visualization**:
    - Apply the best hyperparameters to both datasets and visualize the final clustering results.

## Results and Conclusion

- **Optimal Hyperparameters**:
    - Dataset 1: Epsilon = 0.2, Min Samples = 5
    - Dataset 2: Epsilon = 0.2, Min Samples = 5

- **Visualization**:
    - Scatter plots showing the clusters detected by DBSCAN for both datasets.

This practice provides hands-on experience in implementing and understanding the DBSCAN algorithm for clustering real-world datasets. It demonstrates the flexibility of DBSCAN in identifying clusters of varying shapes and densities.

That concludes the practice! üòä‚úåÔ∏è
